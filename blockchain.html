    <h1 class="about_text">Concept </h1>
    <p class="ipsum_text"> The concept of blockchain technology first appeared in academic papers from 1982, in a dissertation discussing “the design of a distributed computer system that can be established, maintained, and trusted by mutually suspicious groups.” But it was a 2008 paper by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” that brought an academic theory into real-world use.

    <h1 class="about_text">DEFINATION
    </h1>
    
    <p class="ipsum_text">Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system.
      A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant’s ledger. The decentralized database managed by multiple participants is known as Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).
      Blockchain is a type of DLT in which transactions are recorded with an immutable cryptographic signature called a hash.
      This means if one block in one chain was changed, it would be immediately apparent it had been tampered with. If hackers wanted to corrupt a blockchain system, they would have to change every block in the chain, across all of the distributed versions of the chain.
      Blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are constantly and continually growing as blocks are being added to the chain, which significantly adds to the security of the ledger.

            <h1 class="website_text">Bitcoin</h1>
            <p class="dolor_text">The purchase and sale of Bitcoin is entered and transmitted to a network of powerful computers, known as nodes.
              This network of thousands of nodes around the world vie to confirm the transaction using computer algorithms. This is known as Bitcoin mining. The miner who first successfully completes a new block is rewarded with Bitcoin for their work. These rewards are paid with a combination of newly minted Bitcoin and network fees, which are passed on to the buyer and seller. The fees can rise or fall depending on the volume of transactions.
              After the purchase is cryptographically confirmed, the sale is added to a block on the distributed ledger. The majority of the network must then confirm the sale.
              The block is permanently chained to all previous blocks of Bitcoin transactions, using a cryptographic fingerprint known as a hash, and the sale is processed.

          <p class="dolor_text">How do NFTs work?</p>
            <p class="dolor_text">At a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain, though other blockchains have implemented their own version of NFTs. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also keeps track of who’s holding and trading NFTs.

          </h1>
            <p class="dolor_text">Digital Asset - NFT is a digital asset that represents Internet collectibles like art, music, and games with an authentic certificate created by blockchain technology that underlies Cryptocurrency. 
              Unique - It cannot be forged or otherwise manipulated. 
              Exchange - NFT exchanges take place with cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on specialist sites.
            </p>              
          <p class="dolor_text">BAYC is a collection of 10,000 Bored Ape NFTs—unique digital collectibles living on the Ethereum blockchain. Your Bored Ape doubles as your Yacht Club membership card, and grants access to members-only benefits, the first of which is access to THE BATHROOM, a collaborative graffiti board. Future areas and perks can be unlocked by the community through roadmap activation.
            THE SPECS</p>
            <p class="dolor_text">Each Bored Ape is unique and programmatically generated from over 170 possible traits, including expression, headwear, clothing, and more. All apes are dope, but some are rarer than others.
              </p>
              <p class="dolor_text">The apes are stored as ERC-721 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and hosted on IPFS. (See Record and Proof.) Purchasing an ape costs 0.08 ETH.
                To access members-only areas such as THE BATHROOM, Apeholders will need to be signed into their Metamask Wallet.
